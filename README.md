REVO
===

REVO is an open platform for building, deploying and running node.js applications. It allows programmers to assemble complex apps in minutes by reusing existing components.

Install REVO
---

```
$ sudo npm install -g revo
```

Run REVO
---
```
$ sudo revo
revo 0.5.0: 
```
The new prompt shows that revo is running and accepting commands.

Type `help` to get the list of available commands. If everything runs well, the commandâ€™s output looks like this:

```
revo 0.5.0: help

  Commands:

    help [command]  Provides help for a given command.
    exit            Exits revo's interactive CLI.

  Command Groups:

    app *           5 sub-commands.
    recipe *        5 sub-commands.
    component *     2 sub-commands.
```
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

Let's try to create a simple application. Type `app` to get the list of application-specific sub-commands:

```
revo 0.5.0: app

  Commands:

    app create [options] <app_name> [recipe]  Create a new app <app_name> in the local repo
    app deploy <app_name>                     Deploy a previously created app
    app list                                  Get a list of local apps
    app run <app_name>                        Run an existing app on the local host
    app search <app_name>                     Search for <app> in local and central repos


```

To create an application you need a recipe. Let's switch to recipes for a second. Type `recipe` for the available recipe sub-commands:

```
revo 0.5.0: recipe

  Commands:

    recipe list             Get a list of local recipes
    recipe load <recipe>    Make <recipe> the current source for app creation, deployment, etc
    recipe pull <url>       Fetch a recipe from <url> to local repo
    recipe search <recipe>  Search for <recipe> in local and central repos
    recipe show <recipe>    Show <recipe> source

  Command Groups:

    recipe add *            1 sub-command.
```

An application recipe can be stored on any server but in order to create an application, you need a copy of the recipe in the local repo. Let's fetch a basic recipe from github:

```
revo 0.5.16: recipe pull https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clonq/revo-recipes/master/hello-world.yaml
recipe hello-world downloaded to local repo
```

Type `recipe list` to show the list of recipes avaiable in your local repository:

```
revo 0.5.0: recipe list

Recipe Name  Version  Platform  Author   Description

hello-world  1.0.0    web       revo     basic Hello World recipe
	
```

The "hello-world" recipe has been successfully downloaded to your local repo. Let's use it to build a new app. Type `app create myapp hello-world` to create a new application named "myapp" using the "hello-world" recipe: 

```
revo 0.5.0: app create myapp hello-world
Using local recipe: hello-world
myapp app created in local repo
```

To verify the application was created, type `app list`:

```
revo 0.5.0: app list

Application Name  Repository

myapp             local
```

The app is now available in the local repo. To retrieve the app from the repository and package it as a standalone node.js application, use `app package`:

```
revo 0.5.0: app package myapp
myapp has been packaged to /revo/demo/myapp.zip
```
The app is now available as a zip file in your current directory. Exit revo, unzip the new app in the directory of your choice and run the app:

```
revo 0.5.0: exit
See you soon

Recipes
---
In the REVO world, you use recipes to create new applications. Recipes are .yaml files that describe how an application should be assembled from components. Let's have a look at the hello-world recipe. At revo prompt type `recipe show hello-world`:

```
revo 0.5.0: recipe show hello-world
{
    "name": "hello-world",
    "description": "basic Hello World recipe",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "revo",
    "platform": {
        "type": "web",
        "theme": {
            "name": "initializr/bootstrap",
            "url": "http://www.initializr.com/builder?boot-hero&jquerymin&h5bp-iecond&h5bp-chromeframe&h5bp-analytics&h5bp-favicon&h5bp-appletouchicons&modernizrrespond&izr-emptyscript&boot-css&boot-scripts",
            "zip_path": "initializr",
            "placeholders": [
                {
                    "main": ".jumbotron"
                },
                {
                    "login": "#navbar form"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "components": [
        {
            "clonq/revo-ui-bootstrap": {
                "type": "web",
                "repo": "github"
            }
        },
        {
            "revo/hello-world": {
                "type": "web"
            }
        }
    ],
    "config": {
        "clonq/revo-ui-bootstrap": {
            "load": "revo/hello-world",
            "remove": "nav"
        }
    }
}
```
The important sections in a recipe are: `platform`, `components` and `config`.

<h4>Platform</h4>


The `platform` key in a revo recipe describes and optionally configures some high level aspects of the application. The `type` sub-key informs the revo application generator module about the environment the generated application will run on and can have two values `cli` or `web`.

For web applications, a second `theme` sub-key defines the web theme or the web page layout. If the theme was created on developer's machine and thus already available in the local repo, a `name` key is enough to retrieve it and generate the web app page layout. The theme could be stored anywhere though and referenced via the `url` key. The hello-world recipe leverages [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)'s Bootstrap template.

When the `url` is present, revo downloads the theme locally, unpacks it and registers the template with the local repo for future references.

The `placeholders` key defines DOM elements that can be used by web components to inject their content into the web page. The hello-world component for example overwrites Bootstrap's original content of the .jumbotron div element.

<h4>Components</h4>


The `components` section is a list of component entries. Each entry has a `name` key, a `repo` key identifying where the component should be fetched from and optionaly a `type` key.

The component name uniquely identifies the component within te repo.

The repo can be either the keyword `github` or an url. Revo will try to download the component from the repo url. If the value of the repo key is `github`, revo will fetch the component from *https://github.com/`name`/archive/master.zip*

The type of a component can be either `common` or `web`. If no type is specified, `common` will be assumed.


<h4>Config</h4>


The `config` section holds configuration data specific to each component. For example, the hello-world recipe configures a UI bootstrap component to automatically load the revo/hello-world web component everytime the user hits application's main page and to remove the *nav* element originally present in the bootstrap html template.

Components
---
Components are the main ingredient of a revo recipe. They are regular node.js modules that follow a certain design pattern in order to communicate with the other components within a revo runtime container. Components can of one of two types: `common` or `web`. Common components don't have a UI, web components are designed to live in a web page.

Components can be stored anywhere on the web. When declared in a recipe, the revo engine retrieves them from the specified url and caches them in the local repo. When the application is assembled, the declared components are copied to the application directory and the application configuration is updated to contain component-specific config.

Revo components are designed to be reused in any revo-generated application. The recipe for a new application simply lists the required components and their optional configuration elements. The rest is taken care by the evant-based communication mechanism leveraged by the revo runtime.

Everyone is encouraged to write revo components following the [revo design principles for component development]().

Here are some components I developed for the revo platform: [revo-config](https://github.com/clonq/revo-config),
[revo-config-ui](https://github.com/clonq/revo-config-ui), 
[revo-ui-bootstrap](https://github.com/clonq/revo-ui-bootstrap), 
[revo-webbridge](https://github.com/clonq/revo-webbridge), 
[revo-profile-ui](https://github.com/clonq/revo-profile-ui), 
[revo-profile](https://github.com/clonq/revo-profile),
